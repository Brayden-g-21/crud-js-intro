# crud-js-intro

Crud is a way of adding interaciveness for users by allowing them to interact with stored data in the system and/or the servers. 
It adds persistent storage to a program, which allows the user to interact with that data in many different ways.
Users will be able to create, read, update and delete data. Almost every single program runs crud functions. Without that 
interactiveness, users wouldn't get as much use out of a program. Most websites for example require a username, password,
profile preferences, etc. That itself is data that is stored by crud functions, and they allow the user to have access to
information that they have specifically interacted with so that the application is better suited to their needs.
